SparkFun Window Comparator
========================================

![SparkFun Window Comparator](https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/4/3/4/1/10101-01.jpg)

[*SparkFun Window Comparator (WIG-10101)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10101)

This little breakout board allows you to hook up an analog signal, define your voltage window, and it will tell you (digitally - HIGH or LOW) if your input is inside or outside the window.
You can define the upper and lower limits of the voltage window by adjusting to trim pots on the board. 
Power it up with 5Vs, set your limits, and youâ€™ll be ready to go! It accepts voltages from 0V to 5V.
